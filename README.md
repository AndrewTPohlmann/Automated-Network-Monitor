# Automated Network Monitor

The goal of this project is to gather and persist ping data (RTT times / %Loss), and then transform this data into visual projections for the purposes of analysis.

**System Use Cases:**
- Create and begin ping jobs, or delete currently running jobs.
- Create visual projections in the GUI based on persisted data sets from the back-end.
- Allow some CRUD operations against the back-end DB datasets.

**Current Build:**
